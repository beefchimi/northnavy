			%h5 Bacaro
			%p On practically every calle, salizada and ruga in Venice, you’ll find a Bacaro - a casual place to grab a glass of wine or Prosecco and a bite to eat, known as &ldquo;cicheti.&rdquo;
			%p Bacari are Italy’s answer to the pub, and cicheti are the Italian answer to Spanish tapas. Italians have an answer for everything.
			%p Situated at the rear of the restaurant, our Bacaro upholds the Italian tradition of togetherness. It’s the perfect place to meet friends after work, or to share a casual glass of sparkling wine and a small bite to eat.
